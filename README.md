This is a simple project created for my Computer Graphics class at university
demonstrating 3D rendering using the OpenGL API.

# Project Setup

## Dependencies

This project requires the following DLL file to run:

- `assimp-vc143-mt.dll` located in `Ducks3D/lib/libs/`

## Running the build

1. Build the project as usual.
2. Copy `assimp-vc143-mt.dll` from the `Ducks3D/lib/libs/` folder into the same folder as the executable (e.g., `/build/Debug/`).
3. Run the executable.

**Note:** The `.dll` must be in the executable folder or accessible via your system PATH for the application to run correctly.
